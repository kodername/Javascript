      <span id="frist" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often
      abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the
      World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. As of
      2023, 98.7% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the
      client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party
      libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users'
      devices. <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
      is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
      supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It
      has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
      dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
      Object Model (DOM).
